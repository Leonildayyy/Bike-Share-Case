# Bike share case study

Introduction
This project uses a dataset from Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, we need to gain insights about how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the marketing team will launch new strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. The data is from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/dsnerd00/cyclistic-bike-share/input.
