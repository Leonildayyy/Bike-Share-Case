# Bike share case study

# Introduction

This project utilizes a dataset from Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The marketing director believes that the company's future success hinges on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Thus, it is crucial to gain insights into the differing usage patterns of casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic bikes. These insights will be used by the marketing team to develop new strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The data can be found on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/dsnerd00/cyclistic-bike-share/input.

# Business Metrics

## 1. Ride Frequency by User Type (Weekly Patterns)
Metric: Number of rides per weekday for casual riders vs. members.
Business Insight: Understanding the day-of-week usage patterns can help tailor marketing strategies. For example, if casual riders are more active on weekends, promotions or discounts could be offered to convert them into members during those peak times.
## 2. Weekend vs. Weekday Ride Distribution
Metric: Number of rides during weekdays vs. weekends for both casual riders and members.
Business Insight: Analyzing the distribution between weekdays and weekends can reveal user preferences. If casual users prefer weekends, creating weekend-centric membership plans or offering special weekend benefits might increase conversions.
## 3. Bike Type Preference by User Type
Metric: Distribution of rideable bike types (e.g., electric bikes, docked bikes) between casual riders and members.
Business Insight: Understanding which bike types are preferred by casual users vs. members can inform inventory management and marketing strategies. If casual riders prefer a specific bike type, it may be beneficial to promote memberships featuring those bikes.
## 4. Average Ride Duration by User Type
Metric: Average duration of rides for casual riders vs. members.
Business Insight: The average ride length can indicate different usage behaviors. If casual riders take longer trips, offering membership options that include longer ride durations without extra charges could appeal to them.
## 5. Peak Hour Usage by User Type
Metric: Number of rides per hour for casual riders vs. members throughout the day.
Business Insight: Identifying peak usage times allows for better resource allocation and targeted promotions. For example, if members are more active during certain hours, prioritizing bike availability for them could enhance satisfaction and retention.
## 6. Top 10 Starting and Ending Stations
Metric: Most popular starting and ending stations based on ride frequency.
Business Insight: The most popular stations could be ideal locations for targeted advertising, promotional activities, or infrastructure improvements to enhance user experience. These stations might also be the best places to push for membership sign-ups.

These metrics can be used to guide Cyclistic's marketing strategies, customer segmentation, and operational planning to increase annual memberships and improve overall service.
